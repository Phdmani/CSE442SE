Project Description:

  Web App allowing users to better gague their compatability with a movie than would be found on streaming sites (such as netflix or hulu). Esentially users rate movies on 4-5 criteria (overall rating, would you rewatch it, enjoyment, etc). Use this information to build a basic profile and then compare their results to find other similar users, and movies they would likely enjoy but haven't seen yet, and assign the movies a score, then recommend the highest compatible movies to the users.
